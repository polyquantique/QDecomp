# # Using the `grid_algorithm_1D.py` module
#
# In this notebook, the `grid_algorithm_1D.py` module is presented with examples. This module allows to find all the solutions of a **1-dimensional grid problem** in the ring $\mathbf{\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]}$.

# ## $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$
#
# $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ is the ring of quadratic integers with radicand 2. It consist of the set $\{a + b\sqrt{2}\ |Â a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. Let $\alpha = a + b\sqrt{2}$ be an element of the ring. The $\sqrt{2}$-conjugation of $\alpha$, denoted $\alpha^{\bullet}$, is given by $a - b\sqrt{2}$. For more details on this topic, see [Ross and Selinger, 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.2975). The class `Zsqrt2`, found in the `Zsqrt2.py` module, allows to do symbolic calculation with elements of the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$. The following code shows examples of basic arithmetic operations supported by the class.

# ## 1-dimensional grid problem
#
# Consider two real closed intervals $A = [x_0, x_1]$ and $B = [y_0, y_1]$. The grid problem for $A$ and $B$ consists of finding all the solutions $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ such that $\alpha \in A$ and $\alpha^{\bullet} \in B$. If $A$ and $B$ are finite intervals, the grid problem is guaranteed to have a finite number of solutions. For more information, see [Ross and Selinger, 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.2975). The `grid_algorithm_1D.py` Python module contains functions to work with 1-dimensional grid problems:
#
# 1. `solve_grid_problem_1d()`
#
# This function takes as arguments the limits of the two intervals and returns the solutions of the associated 1D grid problem. The solutions are given as a list of Zsqrt2 objects.
#
# 2. `plot_grid_problem()`
#
# This function takes as argument the solutions of the grid problem and the two intervals limits. It plots the solutions on the real axis and their conjugate. It also shows the intervals $A$ and $B$.
#
# # Usage example

from qdecomp.grid_problem import plot_grid_problem, solve_grid_problem_1d

# Let's consider the two arbitrary intervals $A = [1, 6]$ and $B = [-11, -5]$. We can define the limits of those intervals as tuples:

A = (1, 6)
B = (-11, -5)

# The 1D grid problem for those intervals can be solved using the `solve_grid_problem_1d()` function:

solutions: list[Zsqrt2] = solve_grid_problem_1d(A=A, B=B)
print(f"{len(solutions)} solutions were found.")
print("Solutions: ", solutions)

# We can see that each solution $\alpha_i$ is in the interval $A$ and that their conjugate $\alpha_i^{\bullet}$ is in $B$. Let's look at the first solutions for instance:

solution_1: Zsqrt2 = solutions[0]
print(f"{solution_1 = } = {float(solution_1):.3f}")
print(f"{solution_1.conjugate() = } = {float(solution_1.conjugate()):.3f}")

# We can also use the `plot_grid_problem()` function to plot the solutions of the grid problem:

plot_grid_problem(A=A, B=B, solutions=solutions)

# An important fact is that the number of solutions found increase linearly with the size of A and B. If the intervals are too small, no solution will be found.

A = (4, 9)
B = (0.2, 1)
solutions: list[Zsqrt2] = solve_grid_problem_1d(A=A, B=B)
print(f"Solutions: {solutions}")
plot_grid_problem(A=A, B=B, solutions=solutions)
