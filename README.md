# QDecomp
`QDecomp` is a standalone software package to perform multiple decompositions of single qubit and two-qubit quantum gates.

The package primarily focuses on decomposing gates into the Clifford+T universal subset by implementing the algorithm proposed by Ross and Selinger [[1]](#ref1).

This package was made in collaboration with D-Wave and Polytechnique Montréal.

The package contains 4 main subpackages:
* **decompositions** : Proposes user-oriented functions for decomposing various quantum gates
* **utils** : Contains the core algorithms and additional utility functions
* **rings** : Implements classes for symbolic calculations in mathematical rings
* **plot** : Offers visualization tools of core parts of the algorithm used mainly for debugging

Below is a figure illustrating the subpackages (green) and their associated modules (yellow) and classes (orange).

```

## Usage Examples

### Example #1: Single-Qubit Gate Decomposition

This example demonstrates the use of the `qdcomp.decompositions.sqg_decomp` function to decompose single-qubit gates (SQG) into the Clifford+T universal subset up to a tolerance error $\varepsilon$. Note that the algorithm guarantees the specified error only for $R_z$ gates, meaning the total error for SQG may exceed the user-defined tolerance due to error propagation.   

```pycon
>>> from qdecomp.decompositions import sqg_decomp
>>> import numpy as np
>>> U = np.array([ # Unitary matrix
...     [0.5 + 0.5j, -0.5 - 0.5j],
...     [-0.498 + 0.502, -0.498 + 0.502]
... ])
>>> sequence = sqg_decomp(U, epsilon=1e-2)
>>> print(sequence)
Z H S H S T H T H S T H T H S T H T H S T H T H S T H T H S T H T H T H T H T H T H T H S T H S T H S T H T H T H T H S T H T H Z S H S T H Z
```

### Example #2: Two-Qubit Gate Decomposition
This example demonstrates the use of the `qdecomp.decompositions.tqg_decomp` function to decompose two-qubit gates (TQG) into the Clifford+T universal subset up to a tolerance error $\varepsilon$. The function outputs a `list` of `QGate` objects representing the circuit. The target qubits and the corresponding sequence can be accessed through the `QGate.target` and `QGate.sequence` properties respectively.

```pycon
>>> from qdecomp.decompositions import tqg_decomp
>>> import numpy as np
>>> U = np.array([ # Unitary matrix
...     [ 0.250 + 0.604j , -0.104 - 0.250j , 0.250 + 0.604j , -0.104 - 0.250j ],
...     [ -0.104 - 0.250j , 0.250 + 0.604j , -0.104 - 0.250j , 0.250 + 0.604j ],
...     [ 0.104 + 0.250j , 0.250 + 0.604j , 0.104 + 0.250j , 0.250 + 0.604j ],
...     [ -0.104 - 0.250j , -0.250 - 0.604j , -0.104 - 0.250j , -0.250 - 0.604j ]
... ])
>>> circuit = tqg_decomp(U, epsilon=1e-2) # List of QGate objects
>>> for gate in circuit:
...     print(f"{gate.target} -> {gate.sequence}")
...
