Introduction
============

Overview
--------

:mod:`QDecomp` is a standalone software package to perform multiple decompositions of single-qubit and two-qubit quantum gates.

The package primarily focuses on decomposing gates into the Clifford+T universal subset by implementing the algorithm proposed by Ross and Selinger :cite:`intro_ross`.

The package contains 4 main subpackages:

* :mod:`decompositions` : Proposes user-oriented functions for decomposing various quantum gates
* :mod:`utils` : Contains the core algorithms and additional utility functions
* :mod:`rings` : Implements classes for symbolic calculations in mathematical rings
* :mod:`plot` : Offers visualization tools of core parts of the algorithm used mainly for debugging

Below is a figure illustrating the subpackages (green) and their associated modules (yellow) and classes (orange).
